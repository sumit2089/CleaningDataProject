CleaningDataProject
===================

This repository is for submission of the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data

The script run_analysis.R contains R code which shall do the following:

1. Read the given raw data (both training and test data)
2. Process the raw data (merging data, labeling variables, activity labels)
3. Generate a separate data set containing only measurements of mean and standard deviation
4. Compute the average values for each measurement for each subject and each activity
5. Output the datasets into separate files.

The CodeBook.md file contains the description of the variables, the data and the transformations done on the data for cleaning up the data.
